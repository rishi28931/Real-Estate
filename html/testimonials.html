We would highly recommend Tamara to anyone wanting to sell or buy (or both)
a house.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Jeff - Waukesha</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;It has been a great pleasure working with Lynn Friedman.  I met her several years ago and we have worked together in buying or selling at least five condos.  Lynn has always been quick to respond and truly concerned with any concerns Iâ€™ve had.  She has gone far and above any 6% Realtor Iâ€™ve used in the past.  I am fully confident in referring her to anyone wanting to list or buy a property.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Steve - Sturtevant</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;Bonnie Lemmer was our real estate agent when we were selling our house that we had owned for almost 40 years.  We were so pleased with her helpfulness of information and suggestions.  We were impressed with her enthusiasm and knowledge she provided us through the entire sale.  The house sold quickly and we felt so comfortable with Bonnie through the whole transaction.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Harry and Shirley - Menomonee Falls</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg"style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;Dawn was very responsive and friendly! We appreciate all the effort she put into promoting our listing and making it known to other agents. In the â€œeleventh hourâ€ when the buyers stipulated a large added expense/credit before closing, she went above and beyond to offset part of the cost to us. Truly exceptional!! We would definitely recommend Dawn Easaman and Benefit Realty to others looking to sell their home!&quot;<br /><br /><b>-  - West Bend</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;Lynn is a delightful lady, priced my unit at the correct price and I received everything I wanted by listing with her. I couldn't be happier since I didn't have to pay six percent commission and received full asking price.&quot;<br /><br /><b>-  - Franklin</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;Benefit Realty should be the first call you make when considering selling or buying a home. When planning to sell our home, I specifically reached out to Tamara based on the market area. She was responsive and very helpful planning for the sale, even though we weren't ready to list yet. When I was ready to list the home five months later, she was again there for everything I needed. I felt very confident that she knew the market and what was best for us. We had great response to our listing and within a few days we had several offers . Tamara was very accessible, responsive and knowledgeable through the whole process and our home sold for over the asking price. I highly recommend Benefit Realty and Tamara.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Scott and Wendy - East Troy</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;Natalie Kieffer was our Realtor from Benefit Realty.  She was very professional and very honest with us when we interviewed her.  We felt she was the right person to sell our home.
She help us with staging our home when we listed it.  We had two offers within 5 days of listing
our home.  We would recommend her and Benefit Realty to our friends who might be looking for a Realtor.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Terry and Bonnie - Waukesha</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;When I decided to sell my house I originally considered a 6% Realtor who convinced me that he had more resources at his disposal. After talking with Angela of Benefit Realty she convinced me that she would provide everything that anyone else would and do it better for 2% less. Angela provided an excellent description and plan for the sale of my property. The photographer took excellent pictures of the house which amazed me seeing my own house from her perspective. In 2 days I had 29 visits with multiple offers. Angela kept all the potential buyers informed that there were offers in progress this resulted in bidding which increased $8000 over my asking price. All together I saved and made over $14,000 due to Angela and benefit Realty. Why use anyone else!&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Don - Oak Creek</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;If anybody is looking for an awesome Realtor, Lynn Friedman from Benefit Realty.  She was really nice, responded back super fast, walked me through the process and she got the deal done and sold my house in less than 24 hours.  Thanks Lynn for all your help!&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Mike - West Allis</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg"style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;I'm glad I hired Shawn to sell my property in southeast Wisconsin. He had a great knowledge of the area market and worked tirelessly to ensure all documents were reviewed and completed in a timely manner - going over each document to discuss the pros and cons of offers. I would recommend Shawn to anyone looking to sell a property in the SE Wisconsin area.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Nicole - Raymond</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;Great job helping us purchasing a new home and selling our old one. Would highly recommend!! Did a excellent job for us navigating thru all the paperwork.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Bill and Trisha - Waukesha</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;We have loved working with Shawn on both the sale of our old house along with the purchase of our new home. He is responsive and keeps you abreast of everything. Referred him to friends that have used him and enjoyed their experience as well. Will continue recommending Shawn. Thanks for everything!&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Kris and Kori - Mukwonago</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;Shawn was amazing, always on top of things. He made selling our home a breeze. We highly recommend Shawn and Benefit Realty saved us a ton of money because of their low commission rates.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Tom and Ellen - Kenosha</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg"style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;In all our years of buying and selling homes we have never had the pleasure of working with a real estate professional as thorough and reliable as Shawn. Never "pushy", extremely efficient and very pleasant to work with.&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Greg and Donna - South Milwaukee</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg"" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;Barb and I wanted to thank you for the excellent service you provided in successfully selling our house in Menomonee Falls.

In addition, we appreciated the quality of the photography that you arranged that made a favorable impression on prospective buyers.  Just as ayour marketing materials indicate, you and Benefit Realty provided a full service listing and seller representation.  Further, you provided these services at a very competitive commission, resulting in significantly more net sales proceeds for us.

Condo sold quickly and well above assessed value!&quot;<br /><br /><b>- Trish - Milwaukee</b><br /><br /><br /><img align="right" src="../img/logo.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; ">&quot;I wanted to share my story with you and other people who are thinking of buying or selling their home.

       My story with Benefit Realty is a great one, to say the least. I, spent months thinking about selling my home. I just did not feel ready to make, The Move ! 

I did not think my home was up to snuff, ready to place on the market. I had heard horrific stories from friends and family regarding the cost of getting a Realtor.

 

         A friend of mine told me about Benefit Realty. I was skeptical, to say the least. But, I took the plunge and made a phone call, its only a phone call, right ?

I called on a Thursday afternoon, and spoke with Julane Myers. It was like speaking to a good friend, no BS. Julane is an extremely intelligent, caring, honest person who knows the ins and outs of the business.  We became friends in the matter of minutes, she is just the person I wanted and needed in the adventure of selling my home. My home went on the Market that Thursday night.


         Julane and I met that evening in my home, again it was like seeing a good friend.  She and I did a walk through of my home of 10 years.  It was tough for me to sell. I was married and Divorce in my home.  I took care of a sick loved one, celebrated Holidays, Birthdays and had very positive life experiences in my home.

Julane was with me every step of the way and was a shoulder to lean on, when I needed to talk with a friend. 


               It was also very emotional for me to allow strangers into my home for showings. Julane made it easy, I knew the days and times of each showing, it was very easy to plan ahead.  We got nothing but positive feed back from buyers and bidders. A few people even wrote kind letters about my home.

 

                My home received four offers/bids in four days and the house was sold in less then a weekend. Benefit Realty, Julane walked with me, holding my hand, every step of the way. I can honestly say, I would not trust another Realty Company other than Benefit Reality, the staff and Julane as my Realtor.


               Julane is a true gift.
